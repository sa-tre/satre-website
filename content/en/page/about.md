SATRE (Standardised Architecture for Trusted Research Environments) started as a DARE UK Driver Project working to standardise access to secure data in trusted research environments, and included University of Dundee, Alan Turing Institute, UCL, Ulster University, and Research Data Scotland.

Version 1.0 of SATRE was published in 2023, and we're now working on refining it with the goal of published version 2.0 this year.
We are also working with interested parties to help them evaluate or build their own TREs and related infrastructure.
